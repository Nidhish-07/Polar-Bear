  "content": "So: if you want to become any kind of web developer, you absolutely need to learn this language\u2014and you should start with plain old vanilla JavaScript first. If you\u2019re to work out how long to give to get up to speed on the language, senior developer Maven shows you how long it should take to pick up JavaScript. The best way to start learning JavaScript is to get hands-on.\\nOnce you\u2019ve read up on what the language is and how it works, give it a go in your browser. If you\u2019re using Google Chrome, just click \u201CView\u201D then select \u201CDeveloper\u201D from the drop-down menu. From there, select \u201CJavaScript Console\u201D and you\u2019re good to go! As with most things, there are plenty of good resources on the web for teaching yourself JavaScript. However, if you want a more structured approach, consider a mentored web development course. Whichever route you take, make sure you spend enough time learning all the basics.\\nOnce you know JavaScript inside out, you\u2019re well-equipped to tackle the more complex languages of the web, as well as to show the benefits to the next person who asks themselves why learn JavaScript when there are other coding options out there.",

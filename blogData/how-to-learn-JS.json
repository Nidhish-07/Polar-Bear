  "content": "So: if you want to become any kind of web developer, you absolutely need to learn this language—and you should start with plain old vanilla JavaScript first. If you’re to work out how long to give to get up to speed on the language, senior developer Maven shows you how long it should take to pick up JavaScript. The best way to start learning JavaScript is to get hands-on.\nOnce you’ve read up on what the language is and how it works, give it a go in your browser. If you’re using Google Chrome, just click “View” then select “Developer” from the drop-down menu. From there, select “JavaScript Console” and you’re good to go! As with most things, there are plenty of good resources on the web for teaching yourself JavaScript. However, if you want a more structured approach, consider a mentored web development course. Whichever route you take, make sure you spend enough time learning all the basics.\nOnce you know JavaScript inside out, you’re well-equipped to tackle the more complex languages of the web, as well as to show the benefits to the next person who asks themselves why learn JavaScript when there are other coding options out there.",
